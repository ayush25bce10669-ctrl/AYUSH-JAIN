# EMI Calculator (Graphical User Interface using Python Tkinter)



###  Overview of the Project



This project is a Python-based EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) Calculator built using Tkinter, Python’s standard GUI library.

It allows users to calculate:



Monthly EMI



Total Interest payable



Total Amount payable



Complete Amortization Schedule in a scrollable table



The application provides a simple, fast, and user-friendly interface suitable for students, developers, and finance learners.

📥 Steps to Install \& Run the Project

1️- Install Python



Ensure Python 3.x is installed.

Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/



2️- Create a Project Folder

mkdir emi\_calculator

cd emi\_calculator



3️- Save the Python File



Create a file named:



emi\_gui.py





Paste the full code of the GUI EMI Calculator inside it.



- Run the Application



Use the command:



python emi\_gui.py





The GUI window will open.



- Instructions for Testing



Follow these steps to test the EMI Calculator:



Launch the application.



Enter:



Loan Amount (e.g., 500000)



Interest Rate (e.g., 7.5)



Tenure (Years) (e.g., 10)



Click Calculate EMI.



Verify:



EMI is calculated correctly.



Total Interest and Total Payment appear.



Click Show Amortization Schedule.



Scroll through the month-wise detailed schedule.



Test edge cases:



Zero interest rate



Small loans (e.g., ₹1000)



Long tenures (30 years)



Invalid inputs (empty or letters)
